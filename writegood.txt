Returns Emotion object styles friendly media queries for breakpoint names.

The queries follow the min-width syntax suitable for mobile first design / progressive enhancement. Mobile first design starts with the smallest screen. Then goes after the large screens.

This design system sets the first breakpoint to mobile. This means the design starts with the watch or the feature phone. See breakpoints for details.
